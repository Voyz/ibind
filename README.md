IBind is an unofficial Python API client library for the [Interactive Brokers Client Portal Web API.][ibkr-docs] (recently rebranded to Web API 1.0 or CPAPI 1.0) It supports both REST and WebSocket APIs of the IBKR Web API 1.0. Now fully headless with support for [OAuth 1.0a][wiki-oauth1a] and OAuth 2.0.

_Note: IBind currently supports only the Web API 1.0 since the [newer Web API][web-api] seems to be still in beta and is not fully documented. Some of its features may work, but it is recommended to use the Web API 1.0's documentation for the time being. Once a complete version of the new Web API is released IBind will be extended to support it._

## Installation

```rich
pip install ibind
```

## Authentication

IBind supports fully headless authentication using [OAuth 1.0a][wiki-oauth1a] and OAuth 2.0. This means no longer needing to run any type of software to communicate with IBKR API.

Alternatively, use [IBeam][ibeam] along with this library for easier setup and maintenance of the CP Gateway.

See [Authentication][wiki-authentication] page to learn more.

## Overview

IBind's core functionality consists of two client classes:

* [`IbkrClient`][ibkr-client-docs] - for [IBKR REST API][ibkr-endpoints]

  Using the `IbkrClient` requires constructing it with appropriate arguments, then calling the API methods.

* [`IbkrWsClient`][ibkr-ws-client-docs] - for [IBKR WebSocket API][ibkr-websocket]

  Using the `IbkrWsClient` involves handling three areas:

  * Managing its lifecycle. It is asynchronous and it will run on a separate thread, hence we need to construct it, start it and then manage its lifecycle on the originating thread.
  * Subscribing and unsubscribing. It is subscription-based, hence we need to specify which channels we want to subscribe to and remember to unsubscribe later.
  * Consuming data. It uses a queue system, hence we need to access these queues and consume their data.

Their usage differs substantially. Users are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the `IbkrClient` class first.

## Examples

See [all examples][examples].

### Basic REST Example

```python
from ibind import IbkrClient

# Construct the client
client = IbkrClient()

# Call some endpoints
print('\n#### check_health ####')
print(client.check_health())

print('\n\n#### tickle ####')
print(client.tickle().data)

print('\n\n#### get_accounts ####')
print(client.portfolio_accounts().data)
```

### Basic WebSocket Example

```python
from ibind import IbkrWsKey, IbkrWsClient

# Construct the client. Assumes IBIND_ACCOUNT_ID and IBIND_CACERT environment variables have been set.
ws_client = IbkrWsClient(start=True)

# Choose the WebSocket channel
ibkr_ws_key = IbkrWsKey.PNL

# Subscribe to the PNL channel
ws_client.subscribe(channel=ibkr_ws_key.channel)

# Wait for new items in the PNL queue.
while True:
  while not ws_client.empty(ibkr_ws_key):
    print(ws_client.get(ibkr_ws_key))
```
