* Get stock security data by symbol
* Showcase using StockQuery class for advanced stock filtering
* Get conids by using StockQuery queries
* Showcase an error encountered when getting conids returns multiple contracts or instruments

    The get_conids() method will raise an exception if the filtered stocks response doesn't provide exactly one conid.
    The default_filtering filtered the returned contracts by isUS=True which usually returns only one conid.
    If multiple conids are found, you must provide additional conditions for the particular stock in order in order to ensure only one conid is returned.
